    At Action I learned the basics of working in a store. From stocking the shelves to helping customers and to
    cleaning. I was young, wanted to earn some money, so I applied for the job. And I do not regret it to this day, I
    learned a lot and made a lot of friends. I learned the basics of working in the store and this helped with a lot of
    my feature jobs. Because it is not only stocking the shelves but also communicating with my colleagues and the
    customers.

    When I started I was slow and after a few months I was 10 times faster because I understand the importance of
    working hard and proving that you are worth it. With this improvement I got the better aisles. At the end I was
    responsible for stocking the office and arts and crafts aisle.

    After all I learned a handful of useful skills and never regret taking this job.

    When I was 18 and a
    half I started the lessons to get my driver's license. I had lessens for a year, and then I was ready for the exam.
    First I had my theoretic exam, and I passed that one with 0 mistakes, they even posted a picture of me showing that
    I
    had 0 mistakes. After that it was time for the practice exam. I passed this exam in one try.

    The practice exam had a duration of 1 to 1.5 hours in which you drive around in busy parts of the city. Do a few
    maneuvers like parallel parking, reversing and making a U-turn after you have successfully completed all these tasks
    you will drive back to the exam facility, and you will hear if you passed. Luckily I passed the first time.
